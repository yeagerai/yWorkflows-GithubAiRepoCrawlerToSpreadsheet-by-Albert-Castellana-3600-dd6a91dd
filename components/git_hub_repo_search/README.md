# Component Name

GitHubRepoSearch

# Description

The GitHubRepoSearch component is a building block in a Yeager Workflow designed to search for repositories on GitHub using the GitHub API. It takes a query and an API key as input and returns data for the matching repositories in the form of a list of dictionaries.

# Input and Output Models

## Input Model: GitHubRepoSearchInputDict

The input data for the GitHubRepoSearch component consists of the following fields:

- `query` (str): The search query used to look up repositories on GitHub.
- `api_key` (str): The API key to access the GitHub API.

## Output Model: GitHubRepoSearchOutputDict

The output data from the GitHubRepoSearch component consists of the following fields:

- `repos_data` (List[Dict]): A list of matching repositories represented as dictionaries containing repository data.

Both input and output models use the Pydantic `BaseModel` for validation and serialization.

# Parameters

The GitHubRepoSearch component has the following parameters:

- `query` (str): The search query to look up repositories on GitHub.
- `api_key` (str): The API key to access the GitHub API.

# Transform Function

The transform() method in the GitHubRepoSearch component does the following:

1. Takes a GitHubRepoSearchInputDict instance as input.
2. Constructs the GitHub API URL using the provided query.
3. Adds the API key to the request's headers.
4. Makes a request to the GitHub API.
5. Extracts the repository data from the API's response.
6. Returns the data as a GitHubRepoSearchOutputDict instance.

# External Dependencies

The GitHubRepoSearch component requires the following external libraries:

- `requests`: To make requests to the GitHub API.
- `pydantic`: For input and output data validation and serialization.
- `dotenv`: To load environment variables.
- `fastapi`: To create an HTTP endpoint for the transform function.

# API Calls

The component makes a single call to the GitHub API:

- `GET https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=<query>`: Searches for repositories on GitHub using a given query. The API key is supplied in the Authorization header to authenticate requests.

# Error Handling

The component handles errors through the following approach:

- If the API's response does not contain the expected repository data, the component returns an empty list.

# Examples

Here's an example of how to use the GitHubRepoSearch component in a Yeager Workflow:

1. Set up environment variables:
