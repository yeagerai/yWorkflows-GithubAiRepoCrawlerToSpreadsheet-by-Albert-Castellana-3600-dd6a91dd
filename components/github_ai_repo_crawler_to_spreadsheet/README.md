# Component Name: GithubAiRepoCrawlerToSpreadsheet

## Description:

The *GithubAiRepoCrawlerToSpreadsheet* component is a building block of a Yeager Workflow, designed to crawl GitHub AI repositories and save the results into a Google Spreadsheet. The component inherits from the *AbstractWorkflow* base class and implements the *transform()* method to process input data and return output data.

## Input and Output Models:

### Input Model:

The input model *GithubAiRepoCrawlerToSpreadsheetIn* contains the following properties:

- `SearchQuery` (str): The search query for GitHub AI repositories.
- `GoogleApiCredentials` (dict): Google API credentials required to access the Google Spreadsheet.

### Output Model:

The output model *GithubAiRepoCrawlerToSpreadsheetOut* contains the following property:

- `SpreadsheetURL` (str): The URL of the Google Spreadsheet containing the crawled GitHub AI repositories.

## Parameters:

The parameters used in the *GithubAiRepoCrawlerToSpreadsheet* component include:

- `args` (GithubAiRepoCrawlerToSpreadsheetIn): The input data to the component.
- `callbacks` (typing.Any): Function callbacks passed to super.transform().

## Transform Function:

The *transform()* method in the *GithubAiRepoCrawlerToSpreadsheet* component performs the following steps:

1. Call the `super().transform()` method with the provided *args* and *callbacks* to generate the results dictionary.
2. Get the URL of the Google Spreadsheet from the last result in the dictionary using the `SpreadsheetURL` property.
3. Create an instance of *GithubAiRepoCrawlerToSpreadsheetOut* with the obtained *SpreadsheetURL*.
4. Return the instance.

## External Dependencies:

The component relies on the following external dependencies:

- `typing`: For type hinting.
- `dotenv`: To load environment variables.
- `fastapi`: For building the FastAPI application.
- `pydantic`: For data validation and serialization.

## API Calls:

There are no direct external API calls made by the *GithubAiRepoCrawlerToSpreadsheet* component. However, it depends on the *AbstractWorkflow* base class, which may contain external API calls.

## Error Handling:

Error handling for this component is not explicitly implemented, as it relies on error handling provided by the underlying *AbstractWorkflow* base class.

## Examples:

An example of how the *GithubAiRepoCrawlerToSpreadsheet* component can be used within a Yeager Workflow is as follows:
